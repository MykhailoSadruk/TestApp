# TestApp
This is the README.md file for our React Native project with TypeScript. In this file, we will explain how to install `node_modules`, set up `pods` for iOS, and run the application on iOS and Android platforms.

## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (recommended version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) package manager

To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the Node.js packages:

npm install
or if you are using Yarn:
yarn install

This will download and install all the necessary packages listed in the package.json file.

#iOS Setup
To run the application on iOS, you need to set up the Cocoapods dependencies. Please make sure you have Cocoapods installed on your system.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the ios directory within your project.
3. Run the following command to install the Cocoapods dependencies:

pod install

This will install the required iOS dependencies specified in the Podfile and generate an .xcworkspace file.

Running the Application
To run the React Native application on iOS or Android, follow these steps:

#iOS
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to launch the iOS simulator:

npx react-native run-ios
or with Yarn:
yarn react-native run-ios

This will compile the code, build the app, and launch it on the iOS simulator.

#Android
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to launch the Android emulator:

npx react-native run-android
or with Yarn:
yarn react-native run-android

This will compile the code, build the app, and launch it on the Android emulator.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the dependencies, set up the necessary configurations, and launched the React Native application on iOS and Android platforms.
